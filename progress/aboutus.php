                <h2><b>Purpose created</b></h2>

                <p>English For Kids is a website for learning foreign languages for beginners, the specific language
                    here is English and our target audience here is mainly young children.</p>

                <p>Most of the time children learn languages through games. Especially games with adults involved.
                    Children tend to perfect their English skills by watching English programs every day. Instead of
                    having to follow the school curriculum, do the exercises given by the teacher, While the child is
                    not ready to focus on this type of learning, learning by watching the program will make the child
                    less stressed. and not try to meet the standards set out in school.</p>

                <p>Young children often acquire language naturally instead of consciously learning it, because children
                    are more likely to pronounce and have a good sense of language and culture as adults. As children
                    reach puberty, their language acquisition diminishes and they feel the need to consciously learn
                    English through programs and grammar instead of learning in a carefree way. The age of puberty
                    depends on the development of each individual, and the self-consciousness of learning English
                    depends on the expectations of society. So today, many parents choose to expose their children to
                    English from a very young age.

                    To meet the requirements on English For Kids was born.</p>

                <p>The website is simple to operate and completely free, very suitable for young children. People get
                    bored or want to learn a new language for themselves which is limited by many reasons. Here English
                    For Kids can answer your concerns. The little ones just need to keep their spirits up and come to

                    care of. Our mission is to create a healthy playground, where children can both play and learn
